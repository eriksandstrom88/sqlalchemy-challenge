University of Denver Data Analytics Bootcamp Homework #10 - SQLAlchemy Challenge

In this assignment for the Data Analytics Bootcamp, I connected my Jupyter Notebook to a SQLite file (in place of an actual database server) containing weather station data from nine different stations in Hawaii.  I was able to run several queries on the data using the SQLAlchemy module. I ran one query using actual SQL (engine.execute()), and several more queries using python language via the SQLAlchemy tools.  I plotted a couple of the observations in pandas/matplotlib charts.

The second part of the assignment involved creating a very basic "API" to run on the local machine.  Using the same Hawii weather station SQLite file, I was able to query data and have it return in jsonified lists and dictionaries in my browser.  The code for this portion was written in VS Code and executed in bash, then viewed in my Chrome browser.
